Weâ€™re making reading news on the internet more efficient. We work to not only help you find which articles are worth your time, but also which parts of the article are most relevant to you, using Machine Learning on top of crowdsourced data. 

To accomplish this, we have started building and researching a plugin that will augment the experiences users have in existing news aggregators like Facebook, Twitter, and Flipboard. The plugin provides the following two experiences: 

1. Hover Feature: whenever a user hovers over a link on Facebook, for example, we will display a synthesis, containing the key highlights in the article and metrics like projected reading time and the author's reputability score, so the user has a strong understanding of the article before committing to read it. 

We see this as an extension of the auto-summarization bots that are becoming more popular on reddit. Our research surveys show that these bots are frequently a helpful feature for them to better parse content in their news feeds. 

2. Heatmap Feature: when a user reaches the article, we create a heatmap over the text indicating the parts we think will be most relevant or interesting to the user, using machine learning and NLP on top of crowdsourced data.

We think both features allow users to consume news more effectively and efficiently.
